# Brent Fitzgerald

I am a programmer and technical product designer based in Oakland, CA.

For the past five years I've worked on payment technology, with a focus on mobile and developer products. If you've ever paid for something in an app, chances are pretty good that you used my work.

I have spent the last two years with [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com). As the engineering lead of the developer experience team, I help plan, design, and build software that programmers use to accept payments in mobile or web apps. 

Previously I was the first hire at [card.io](https://card.io), and we were acquired by [PayPal](https://paypal.com/). In the more distant past, I founded an [experimental technology design company](https://tacolab.com/), worked at [some](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/swivel) [startups](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sifteo), and studied at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/).
