# Brent Fitzgerald

I am a programmer and technical product generalist based in Oakland, CA.

For the past 5+ years I've worked on payments, with a focus on mobile and developer products. If you've ever paid for something in an app, chances are pretty good that you used my work.

I have spent the last three years with [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com) as an engineer, team manager, and most recently an organization manager. I am currently manager and lead of our Ecosystem org. I help teams that are building new classes of technical payments products. I also focus on hiring and assessment, peer coaching, and fostering a positive and collaborative product and engineering culture.

I was the first hire at [card.io](https://card.io). We were acquired by [PayPal](https://paypal.com/). In the more distant past, I founded an [experimental technology design company](https://tacolab.com/), worked at [some](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/swivel) [startups](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sifteo), and studied at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/).
