title: About

I am a programmer and technical product designer based in Oakland, CA.

## Work

Over the past five years, I have been involved in payment technology with a focus on mobile and developer products. I have spend the last two years with [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com) in San Franicsco. My area of focus has been [developer experience](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/); my team gives programmers the tools, APIs, and documentation needed to accept payments in mobile or web apps.

As an engineering lead and manager, I encourage my colleagues to:

- Regularly do things that feel uncomfortable.
- Take time to reflect on process, team, and self.
- View challenges with multiple lenses.
- Take calculated risks.
- Empathize with our audience.
- Give feedback with sensitivity, and gracefully receive it.
- Trust and respect one another.
- Engage and take responsibility.
- Work wherever, but not whenever.

## Life

I live with my wife and kids in [Temescal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temescal,_Oakland,_California), where I enjoy gardening, drinking coffee, cooking, riding bikes, and reading books.
