I am a programmer and technical product designer based in Oakland, CA.

## Current Work

For the past 5 years I've been working in payments technology, with a focus on mobile and developer products. 

Since early 2014, I have worked at [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com) with a talented team of engineers, designers, writers, product managers, and more. My focus has been the [developer experience](https://developer.braintreepayments.com/)&mdash;offering tools and explanations that are straightforward and that make it easy to accept payments in applications.

As an engineering lead and manager, I encourage my colleagues to:

- Regularly do things that feel uncomfortable.
- Take time to reflect on process, team, and self.
- View challenges with multiple lenses.
- Take calculated risks.
- Empathize with our audience.
- Give feedback with sensitivity, and gracefully receive it.
- Trust and respect one another.
- Engage and own your shit at work.
- Work wherever, but not whenever.

## Before Braintree

Prior to Braintree I was at PayPal, where I designed and co-developed the PayPal mobile in-app payments SDK used by thousands of apps worldwide. As a side project, I also helped re-launch the PayPal developer documentation using a static site generator.

I had joined PayPal in 2012 via acquisition of [card.io](https://card.io/). We developed a library that let mobile applications "scan" credit cards using the phone's camera. I worked on Android and iOS libraries and the backend, plus the UI and brand design. It has since been open-sourced, and is still in use today in countless major applications.
