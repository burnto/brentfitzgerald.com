title: Leading innovative teams
---

I try to cultivate organizations so that team members feel a sense of pride and identity, leaders learn and develop, and unexpected new ideas emerge. 

As a leader, the recipe for a great innovative team isn't surprising or secret:

- Focus on hiring people who are curious, smart, creative, and kind. 
- Encourage curiosity and development of deep expertise.
- Create opportunities for shared wins.
- Give and receive feedback graciously and with compassion.
- Ensure a meaningful mission.
- Communicate simply and clearly.
- Maintain humility and a sense of humor.
