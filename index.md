# Welcome! ðŸ‘½

Hi, I'm Brent Fitzgerald. You've found my little corner of the web. You can learn about me here. Feel free to also [drop me a note](mailto:&#098;+&#119;&#101;&#098;&#099;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#097;&#099;&#116;&#064;&#098;&#114;&#101;&#110;&#116;&#102;&#105;&#116;&#122;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#097;&#108;&#100;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;).

## Status

I recently decided to take a break to work on new ideas. I've been thinking about:

- Tools for new commerce patterns
- Ethical credit / fintech
- New ways of communicating and coordinating
- Happy and effective teams
- Becoming a better writer and thinker
- Helping my friends and teammates

## Brief professional bio

For the past 9 years I've worked on payments, with a focus on mobile and developer products, new commerce behaviors, extensible platforms, and forward-looking use cases. Whenever you pay for something on the web or in a mobile app, there's a good chance you're using code I helped make happen.

Most recently, I have worked with [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com) as an engineer, manager, and leader. I was previously the first hire at [card.io](https://card.io). We were acquired by [PayPal](https://paypal.com/). In the more distant past, I founded an experimental technology design company, worked at a few startups, and built art economies and programmatic contracts at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/).
