# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Brent Fitzgerald, and you've found my little corner of the web. ðŸŒˆ

If you want to learn a bit about me this is a good starting point.

## Current status

I'm thinking about and working on new stuff. Interests include:
- Tools for new commerce patterns
- Ethical credit / fintech
- New ways of communicating and coordinating
- Happy and effective teams
- Becoming a better writer and thinker
- Helping my friends and teammates

## Brief professional bio

For the past 9 years I've worked on payments, with a focus on mobile and developer products, new commerce behaviors, extensible platforms, and forward-looking use cases. Whenever you pay for something on the web or in a mobile app, there's a good chance you're using code I helped make happen.

Most recently, I have worked with [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com) as an engineer, manager, and leader. I was previously the first hire at [card.io](https://card.io). We were acquired by [PayPal](https://paypal.com/). In the more distant past, I founded an experimental technology design company, worked at a few startups, and built art economies and programmatic contracts at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/).

## Leading teams

I try to cultivate organizations so that team members feel a sense of pride and identity, leaders learn and develop, and unexpected new ideas emerge. 

As a leader, the recipe for a great innovative team isn't surprising or secret:

- Focus on hiring people who are curious, smart, creative, and kind. 
- Encourage curiosity and development of deep expertise.
- Create opportunities for shared wins.
- Give and receive feedback graciously and with compassion.
- Ensure a meaningful mission.
- Communicate simply and clearly.
- Maintain humility and a sense of humor.

But it's still a lot of work!
