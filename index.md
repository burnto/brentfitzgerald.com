## Current status

- Happy and effective teams
- Becoming a better writer and thinker
- Helping my friends and teammates

## Brief professional bio

For the past 9 years I've worked on payments, with a focus on mobile and developer products, new commerce behaviors, extensible platforms, and forward-looking use cases. Whenever you pay for something on the web or in a mobile app, there's a good chance you're using code I helped make happen.

I worked with [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com) as an engineer, manager, and leader. In addition to helping drive technical innovation, I also focus on hiring and assessment, peer coaching, and fostering a curious, positive, and collaborative culture that cuts through team boundaries.

I was previously the first hire at [card.io](https://card.io). We were acquired by [PayPal](https://paypal.com/). In the more distant past, I founded an experimental technology design company, worked at a few startups, and built art economies and programmatic contracts at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/).
